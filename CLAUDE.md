## Agent Notes (2026-04-13)

### Environment / Dependency Constraints
- `npm ci` can fail when `package.json` workspace metadata and `package-lock.json` are transiently out of sync, especially after workspace additions.
- The npm registry endpoint may be restricted in some environments (for example, `npm view @typescript-eslint/parser` can return HTTP 403).
- In constrained environments, `npm install --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts` is a safe pre-step to synchronize lock metadata before `npm ci`.

### Current Repository State Guidance
- CI workflow now includes an explicit lockfile synchronization step before dependency install.
- CI matrix in `.github/workflows/test.yml` targets Node `20.x` and `24.x`; local validation in restricted environments may still be limited by registry/network access.

### Recommended Next Steps for Next Agent
1. Re-run GitHub Actions for the current branch to confirm `Install dependencies` passes on both Node matrix lanes.
2. Execute `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, and `npm test` in an environment with full npm registry access.
3. If failures appear, patch and iterate until both matrix lanes pass.
