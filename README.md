## 🗺️ Roadmap Snapshot (Existing + Planned)

### Current repository state (as of April 21, 2026)
- ✅ `VERSION.json` is `1.0.4` and marks the project `stable`.
- ✅ 11 `@h4shed/*` packages are listed as published, with 9 additional skill packages queued for publish.
- ✅ Core docs exist for roadmap/changelog/release orientation and package publishing workflow.

### Open PR queue (GitHub currently shows 8 open)
> Source: https://github.com/Fused-Gaming/Fused-Gaming-Skill-MCP/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen

1. `#109` Add LinkedIn Master Journalist (LIMJ) skill (base: `main`)
2. `#101` ux-journeymapper implementation/docs refresh (base: `feature/syncpulse-skill-docs`)
3. `#81` Feat/socials automation phase1
4. `#79` Socials Automation Asset Pipeline - Phase 1
5. `#19` SVG generation for canvas-design skill
6. `#18` project status tool skill
7. `#17` project manager skill
8. `#16` multi-account session tracking skill

### MVP milestone snapshot (GitHub milestones page)
> Source: https://github.com/Fused-Gaming/Fused-Gaming-Skill-MCP/milestones

- 14 milestones are open, including:
  - `Syncpulse - AI Orchestration & Developer Control Plane`
  - `Social Media Brand Asset Skill`
  - `NPM Package Release` (closed issues complete)
  - `SVG generation for Canvas Design Skill`
  - `Project Manager Skill`
  - `UX Journeymapper Skill`
  - `Mermaid Terminal Skill`
  - `Daily Review Skill`
  - `Multi Account Session Tracking Skill`

### Current blockers
1. GitHub page/API content is partially degraded when unauthenticated (`Uh oh!` load failures on filters/check details), so some check-run evidence must be validated in an authenticated browser session.
2. Open PR queue includes older April 2026 feature branches that need rebase/conflict/testing passes before merge sequencing.
3. At least one open PR (`#101`) still shows a failed Vercel preview deployment signal in visible thread events.

### Current steps
1. Keep README/roadmap/changelog aligned with live GitHub PR + milestone state.
2. Prioritize failing-deployment PR remediation before feature merges.
3. Merge or close stale feature PRs with explicit branch strategy (stacked branch vs `main` direct).

### Immediate next 3 steps
1. Triage and fix failing deployment(s) on open PRs, starting with `#101`.
2. Normalize open feature branches (`#16/#17/#18/#19/#79/#81/#101/#109`) against current `main`.
3. Add/refresh a single merge checklist for each PR with test + deployment evidence links.

### Top 3 priorities now
1. Resolve failing open PR checks/deployments first (do not merge while red).
2. Finish publish-ready implementation for missing high-impact skills (`mermaid-terminal`, `ux-journeymapper`, `svg-generator`, `project-*`).
3. Automate docs/version/package drift checks in CI so release metadata stays accurate.

## 🚢 Release Automation

- **npm publish workflow:** `.github/workflows/publish.yml`
  - Runs lint, typecheck, build, scope preparation, and workspace publish.
- **GitHub release workflow:** `.github/workflows/github-release.yml`
  - Runs on the same release tags (`v*`, `skill-*`) and creates GitHub Releases with generated notes.
- This split keeps npm publishing and release-note generation independently observable and easier to retry.
